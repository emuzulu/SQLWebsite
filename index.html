            <h3>We detected that your code might be SQL Injectable</h3>

            <p>
                Based on your Stackoverflow post we detected that your code might be SQL injectable. We used a ran a Machine Learning model on
                your stackoverflow post that told us that your code might be SQL injectable. If you want to know about how to stop SQL injections,
                continue reading this article.

            <h3>What is SQL injection?</h3>

            <p>
                SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to                its database. It allows the person executing the attack to access information that they normally should not be able to access. In               some cases it can allow the attacker to delete, tamper with the contents of your database or even delete the whole database                     altogether!
            </p>

            <h4>Example</h4>

            Consider an application that allows users to log in with username and password. If a user "janedoe" logs in with their password
            "origami123" then the application would run the SQL query below.

            <code>
                SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'janedoe' AND password = 'origami123'
            </code>

            The attacker can provide an input for username like "'janedoe' OR 1=1 --" and any password text such that the application would have to run the following
            command

            <code>
                SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'janedoe' OR 1=1 -- AND password = "random-text-here"
            </code>

            This command would retrieve every user and password in your database and allow access for that to the attacker. Since everything in the
            same like after -- in treated as a comment no error would occur.

            The attacker could also give a username like "'janedoe'; DROP table; --" and a random password again and in some cases they might be
            able to delete your whole table of users. This is because the script would look like this.

            <code>
                SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'janedoe';   DROP table; -- AND password = "random-text-here"
            </code>

            If the attacker manages to find what your database table name is for your application they can run this script right here and replace
            table with your database table names and delete the tables as well as everything in them.

            <h3>How can you prevent SQL Injections</h3>

            You can prevent SQL injections using the following methods
            <ul>

                <li>
                    Using Prepared Statements
                </li>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Prepared statements allow the server to know what the script looks like in advance such that it knows to interpret input as
                    as input and not as part of the script. Click
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_prepared_statements.asp" target="_blank"> here
                    </a>
                    to learn how to write prepared statements.
                </p>

                <li>
                    Sanitizing inputs
                </li>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Sanitizing the input  is an extra layer that could help make sure that the user doesn't try to use keywords or invalid charaters
                    in order to try to SQL inject the database. This is not 100% effective and must be used with other methods of preventing SQL Injections
                    such as using prepared statements. However it is good practice to make sure that you sanitize inputs so as to help prevent SQL Injections.
